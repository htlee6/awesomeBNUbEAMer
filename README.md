# awesomeBNUbEAMer

The *awesomeBNUbEAMer* is an open project for creating tidy and clean BNU styled beamer templates. 
Personally, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND guys major in *Science & Techs* to use LaTeX and beamer to produce your presentation slides.

And GET RID OF POWERPOINT!

## Overleaf

Overleaf is a website where you can use the template online. [Click Here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/beijing-normal-university-beamer/sdxybqgmngcv)

## LaTeX 

LaTeX is an amazing typesetting system converting commands into stylished articles/books/slides and etc. 
For more details in LaTeX usage, you may want to Google search `LaTex Tutorial`.

## Join In

Be free join in this project! All you need may be 15 mins only to get familiar with the LaTeX command system.
We need your support for more decent slides!
